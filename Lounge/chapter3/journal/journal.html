        <p>Documenting my trip around the USA on my very own Segway!</p>

        <p>My first of the trip! I finally got everything packed and ready to go. 
            Because I'm on a segway, I wans't able to bring a whole lot with me: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>cellphone</li>
            <li>ipod</li>
            <li>digital camera</li>
            <li>protein bar</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said,</p>
        <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one segway.</q></p>

        <p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
            </p>
            <q>Passing cars, <br>
            When you can't see,<br>
            May get you,<br>
            A glimpse, <br>
            Of eternity.</q><br>
            </blockquote>
            <p> I definitely won't be passing any cars."</p>
